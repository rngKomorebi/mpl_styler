## Introduction

This package is a small collection of different style for the plots produced
using matplotlib, including one for paper/presentation/poster-ready graphs.

Currently available styles are:

- 'sci_pure' for clean and paper-ready plots;
- 'sci_bleak' for kind of a sun-faded look with soft colors;
- 'night_wave' for eye-pleasing plots with dark background and neon colors.

The last one is heavily inspired by the 'cyberpunk' style (https://github.com/dhaitz/mplcyberpunk).

There are also a couple of functions for use mostly with the 'night_wave' style for adding glow to and/or a gradient under lines, bars and histograms.

## Installation and usage

Working on a pypi distro. So for now the path of least resistance would be to download the repo and install locally; after cd-ing to where the package is located, run:

```
pip install -e .
```

and you should be good to go.


## Examples

Below are shown all the available styles and functions.
